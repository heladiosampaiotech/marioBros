                        <p>I confess that tears came to my eyes as I graciously reminisced about my childhood and youth, having fun with my friends playing Super Mario, Donkey Kong... Man! What an extraordinary nostalgia. I missed seeing this movie in theaters because I'm sure it would have been emotional and enjoyable. Not because the movie makes you emotional with its plot, but because it brings back good moments from the past.
                            Thank you for this movie. I hope there will be a sequel... I want to see more references, more action, more scenes that will light up my brain and bring back good and fun memories... Oh! And of course... We want to see Yoshi üòÅ.</p>

                        <p>We loved the movie... and when I say "we," I mean because we took our 3-year-old son to watch it...
                            Super Mario, the movie, is a story that we, from the 80s and 90s, know by heart... and it ends up being cliche, but so nostalgic, and for those who are fans of the games, they forgive any shallow plot... but the soundtrack, voice acting, and animation were impeccable in my opinion...
                            As for our son, who plays the game with his father, he was over the moon... you don't know how satisfying it was to see him clapping when Bowser was defeated and turning to me and saying, "Give me a high-five, yes!" because that's how we celebrate when we pass a level... it's these details that stick in your memory...
                            I found the movie beautiful in introducing this story to the new generations... and for those who criticize that the movie was too childish, just look at the 1993 Mario Bros... or as I call it, Mario of Chernobyl... hahaha

                        <p>It was the first movie I watched with my dad on the couch in our house because, as I'm only 3 years old, they are testing whether I can behave in the cinema and then take me to watch a movie during my school vacation. The movie has a really cool story with Mario going on many adventures to save his brother and the princess from the monster. My dad said he loved watching it because it brought back memories of his childhood when he played video games with his siblings and friends. Now I'm convincing my parents that I can behave in the cinema; I'm asking them to take me to watch Paw Patrol as a first test. Thanks, guys! See you next time.</p>
